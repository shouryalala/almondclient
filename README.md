Each user can create a Periferi. A Periferi can any region around you. It can be your neighbourhood, your college, a school etc.
If a certain number of active users present in that area approve your request, the Periferi gets created and thus a community is formed!

Based on your location, you can read, interact and socialize with people in that Periferi. Choosing a Periferi is simple:
  - Pinch in to enter a smaller Periferi
  - Pinch out to check out posts from a larger Periferi around you.
