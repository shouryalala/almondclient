> A Periferi could be any region around you. It could be your neighbourhood, your college, a school etc.
If you create a request for a new Periferi, and a certain number of active users present in that area approve your request, that Periferi gets created and thus a community is formed!

> Based on your location, you can read, interact and socialize with people in that Periferi. Choosing a Periferi you want to interact with  is simple:
>  - Pinch in to enter a smaller Periferi
>  - Pinch out to check out posts from a larger Periferi around you.
