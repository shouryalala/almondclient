# Periferi
Client app

Short Description: A social network built around you.

Description:
Periferi experiments with a new approach to networking.
- A user can create a Periferi request of any area around them.
- If a certain number of people approve, the Periferi gets created, and thus a community is formed. 
- Pinch in to enter a smaller Periferi and Pinch out to check out posts from a larger Periferi around you.
- Socialize and get to know more about the people in your Periferi.
- Add posts about the local attractions, food, bars and the community for the new people entering your Periferi.
